# 2020 fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders Study Group
Collective wisdom of the fast_ai_practical_dl TWIML study group

  ## Background
This repository contains resources found and/or developed by the [TWIML fast.ai Deep Learning for Coders Study Group](https://twimlai.com/program/fast-ai-practical-deep-learning-for-coders-study-group/). Lectures and course materials can be found [here](https://course.fast.ai/). Study group meetings are organized on the TWIML Community Slack server's `fast_ai_practical_dl` channel. To gain access to the Slack server, join the TWIML Community [here](https://twimlai.com/community/).

##   Resources

(Eventually, I envision this section having links to documents detailing, e.g., our experiences setting up various deep learning workflows; notes and examples generated as we work through the course/book; etc. Anything that would be useful!)
